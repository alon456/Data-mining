# Data-mining
Data Minig Course Final Project

The aim of the final project is to demonstrate the assimilation of the material studied in this course, with an emphasis on data mining components.

The project focuses on an international car rental company.The company decided to examine the use of information mining technologies to improve business processes. 
For this purpose, she provided us with anonymous data based of random customers who were involved in the experiment. In this experiment, the customers received a car refueling card, along with a "personal" offer to order a car rental, at an operational price, for a weekend in their city of residence. After a month, they checked which of those customers rented a car after receiving the car refueling card.

Based on the customer response pattern in the sample, the company is interested in developing a model for identifying which customers should be approached.
